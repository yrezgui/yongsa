# Yongsa

Quick search within your favorite cloud services.

I created it using:
- [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for managing the different components of the App


## [Demo](http://www.yrezgui.com/yongsa)

## Getting started
Run this command in your terminal in the directory of the cloned repository to fetch the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

And finally this command to have your automatic build:
```
make sourcemap=1 watch
```

You need a HTTP server to serve your files. I will certainly add an express instance soon. For now, you can use this command (which is useful for a quick HTTP server) :
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Don't forget to run it in the root folder of the project. Enjoy :smiley:
